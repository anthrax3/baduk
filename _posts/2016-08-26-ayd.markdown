On a whim, a week ago I decided to sign up for the 16th season of
[In-seong Hwang's American Yunguseng Dojang](http://ayd.yunguseng.com)
(AYD). This insei style online school came up in several conversations
at US Go Congress and much of the sentiment expressed was very
positive. After my fantastic experience at the US Go Congress, AYD's
round robin tournament format with longer game time controls combined
with lectures and weekly reviews really resonates with me. I signed up
to try it out for a month with the intention of sticking around for
the whole season if it goes well.

It wasn't clear that I would be able to get in since AYD is structured
around around leagues and each league must have at least six
players. Still I was given access to the lectures which I started
going through and I must say I'm impressed by their quality. I crossed
my fingers, in the worst case I could stick around as an observer for
the season. However yesterday I got an email saying I made it in!

Regardless of whether it does or doesn't go well I'm also still
planning on swinging by the
[New York Go Academy](http://www.ny-go.org) when I can. However as
it's about an hour's train ride from my apartment in Brooklyn, I
suspect AYD is probably going to be simpler to fit consistently into
my schedule.
